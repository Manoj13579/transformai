  /* Will Stripe Webhook Requests Be Blocked by Cross-Origin Policy?
The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy governs how browsers allow web pages to make requests to different origins.
Nature of Stripe Webhook Requests
Stripe webhooks are server-to-server HTTP POST requests sent directly from Stripe's servers to your webhook endpoint (e.g., https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe).
These requests are not initiated by a browser, so they are not subject to CORS policies. CORS is a browser security mechanism that applies to client-side JavaScript (e.g., fetch or XMLHttpRequest) making cross-origin requests.Since Stripe's requests originate from their servers (not a browser), they bypass CORS entirely. */
